## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate dev who keeps an eye out for efficient code within the confines of what's reasonable.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my fleet management system which I originally developed when I was working for the public transport operator in my hometown. Currently rewriting it in Go! I hope to build it into a product.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing my master's in logistics and supply chain management in Europe.
